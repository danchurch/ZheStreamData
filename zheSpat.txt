## we want to test a correlation with stream Nitrate values
## we expect nitrification rates to increase with 

## we are focusing on the shallow depth (5 cm), so we have to 
## throw out our upper stream sample site. 
## and comparing to the confluence seems odd to me. 
## so we are down to mid- and down- stream sections. 

## that doesn't leave us much to work with....

## Seems appropriate to use the mean our two 

## also, not sure if amoA is of interest here.
## we have almost none-existent ammonia levels
## not sure if amoA

## so drop Amo, average the mid columns, and the confluence site:

 
Nenz = (enz[enz.Function == "N metabolism"][["Mid-A_5","Mid-B_5","Down_5"]]
        .drop(axis='rows', labels='Ammonia monooxygenase (amoA)'))

## our mean gene count for the mid site is:

N_Mid_5 = Nenz[['Mid-A_5','Mid-B_5']].mean(axis='columns')

## a new, greatly simplified df:

nRedu = pd.concat([N_Mid_5, Nenz['Down_5']], axis='columns')

## so every enzyme in the denitrification pathway shows lower counts

## check in with Zhe, make sure these are all such genes (denitrifying)

###### sulfate #######

## repeat for sulfur. 
## for sulfur oxidizing enzymes: we expect an increase

## let's see: 

Senz = enz[enz.Function == "S metabolism"][["Mid-A_5","Mid-B_5","Down_5"]]

## yeah, that is not clear. I need to talk to Zhe about his expectations
## fore these genes. I don't feel like reading about each of them. 

## involve all samples, including upstream,
## = all depth
## break out the midstream samples
## model all by distance along 



############

## where were we? 

## more work on the nitrification pathway - do an RDA of of de-nitrification 
## genes as a function of distance downstream 

## run this for both depths. 

## which means we need to parse out two matrices, one for each depth. 

## also, how different are the two depths of the stream? 

## run an nms, permanova, etc

## then start thinking about sulfur.

## step 1, separate out depths.

## for the 15 cm samples:

deepSamples = enzEnv.loc["Depth"][enzEnv.loc["Depth"] == 0.15].index.to_list()

## jeezus this is frustrating, we need that missing 
## nitrogen measurement. 

## all the potential denitrification enzymes 
## show the exact same spatial pattern,

## repeat with the shallow samples, how do they look?:

## one interesting article that mentions this gene

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3568144/

## and even more interesting:
https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JB.181.17.5303-5308.1999
## in this article, this operon is proposed to be a

## and so on. 

## how about a dbRDA:




deepNenz.cap <- capscale(deepNenz[-1] ~ deepNenz$Distance, dist="bray")

deepNenz.cap

plot(deepNenz.cap) ## similar as with hellinger transformed, but less informative
anova(deepNenz.cap) ## nope nope nope 




## taking a univariate approach
## can we say there is a statistically significant

## let's go back to...

### python ###

## back to python:

deepNARcounts = deepNenzT['narGHIJK'].reset_index(drop=True)
deepDist = deepNenzT.reset_index()['Distance']

narGHIJK_model = sm.GLM(
                    deepNARcounts,

## hmm, I think I am reading that right, a very small p value. 

## just to make sure, use a function I am a little more familiar with:

deepNARcounts

deepDist

LinearRegression


X = deepDist.values.reshape(-1,1)
Y = deepNARcounts.values.reshape(-1,1)

reg = LinearRegression()

reg.fit(X,Y)

reg.predict(X)

reg.score()
## forgot, no frequentist pvalues for the sklearn people
## they can't be bothered with such dinosaurs

## so use scipy stats:

stats.linregress(deepDist, deepNARcounts) ## but can't fit negative binomial to this

## wonder what organism(s) this operon belongs to?


#### meeting todo list, after talking to Zhe:

## focus more on sulfur
## = rda of sulfur genes
## = look closely at dsrAB and soxYZAXB
## look for correlations between sulfur genes and NarG
## compare gene abundances by depth
## add confluence site to all charts
## model the change in slopes between depths at mid A and mid B 
## look for genes of interest in Sulfuricurvum?
## rerun the hellinger-transformed RDA of nitrogen as a dbRDA?


#### graph all sulfur genes

## probably a mess, but let's graph them all, and run an RDA on them
## might help us pickout genes to focus on


enzEnv

Senz = enz[enz.Function == "S metabolism"]


deepSamples

shallowSamples


## make sulphure gene matrix as above
deepSenz = (enz[enz.Function == "S metabolism"][deepSamples])
shallowSenz = (enz[enz.Function == "S metabolism"][shallowSamples])
aa = (deepSenz.reset_index()['enzyme']
        .str.split(pat="(", n=1, expand=True)[1]
        .str.replace(")","")
    )

fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
deepSenzT.plot.line(title='15cm S-metabolism gene counts', ax=ax1)

## interesting. We see the same shapes in these enzymes. 

## I really hope Zhe did his normalizations right. 

## anyway, assuming he did...

## in the simplest scenario, we would expect sulfur
## oxidation in this system to be coupled with nitrate 
## reduction. So the congruency between some of these
## trends and the n-reducing genes is expected. 

## Zhe was especially interested in dsrAB and soxYZAXB
## soxYZAXB definitely shows a congruent trend as the
## the 

## according to wikipedia, dissimilatory sulfate reduction 
## is a respiration process with sulfate as the final 
## electron acceptor. 

## one would therefore expect activity of this enzyme this to be in competition 
## with reduction of nitrogen, no?

## a plot with just the two genes that Zhe wanted to look at:


plt.close('all')
shallowSenzT[['soxYZAXB', 'dsrAB']]
deepSenzT[['soxYZAXB', 'dsrAB']]
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1, sharex=True)
(deepSenzT[['soxYZAXB', 'dsrAB']]
    .plot.line(title='15cm S-metabolism gene counts', 
    ax=ax[0], legend=False))
(shallowSenzT[['soxYZAXB', 'dsrAB']]
    .plot.line(title='5cm S-metabolism gene counts', 
    ax=ax[1]))

## interestingm soxYZAXB behaves like we would expect.

## can we isolate just the genes that show a dramatic 
## difference between the two mid sites?

plt.close('all')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
(shallowSenzT[['soxYZAXB', 'sat', 'sqr', 'soxC']]
    .plot.line(title='5cm S-metabolism gene counts', 
    ax=ax))
ax.set_xlim(0,550)
ax.set_ylim(0,3000)


## in the case of the 15cm depth, the genes that 
## show congruence with the n-reducers are:
## soxYZAXB', 'soxC', and 'sorAB'
## for 15cm depth, the genes that 
## show congruence with the n-reducers are:
## soxYZAXB', 'soxC', and 'sorAB'
## and for 5 cm:
## 'soxYZAXB', 'sat', 'sqr', 'soxC'

## we can also include dsrAB, a sulfur reducing 
## enzyme that Zhe was interested in, though: 
## 'dsrAB'

## that adds up to:

plt.close('all')
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1, sharex=True)
genes=['soxYZAXB', 'soxC', 'sat', 'sqr','dsrAB']
(deepSenzT[genes]
    .plot.line(title='15cm S-metabolism gene counts', 
    ax=ax[0], legend=False))
(shallowSenzT[genes]
    .plot.line(title='5cm S-metabolism gene counts', 
    ax=ax[1]))

## the two best examples of this are the promoter 'soxYZAXB'
## and the hydrogen sulfide ('sulfane') oxidizing enzyme 'soxC'

## sqr is some sort of sulfar-related quinone electron shuttle thing,
## I think. It also is probably bidirectional, as far as oxidation/reduction

## it is highly congruent in the deeper sediment, but not on the shallow
## sediments. 

## SAT is an enzyme for adenylating sulfate, and can be linked to both 
## oxidation and reducing pathways

## today - redo old rdas, do new rdas, check specific correlations, especially
## with NARG

#### RDA for sulfur

## seems like one approach here would be to run a general RDA with space 
## and a reduction
